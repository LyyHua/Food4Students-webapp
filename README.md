# Dev log (more like my own diary)

Since yapping about my progress in the commit changes kinda "unprofessional"

So now i'm revoke to use these markdown files to yap about my develop progress

I'm starting to fed up with the daily routine of waking up and watching udemy video

So i will deadass drop the godot game and do this project instead

This is the web app microservice version for our original android Food4Students app

# Log 2

The fucking reason why i'm deleting this the fucking 4th times is because there's a fucking .git folder in frontend

Then github doesn't know wtf that is and just fucking ignore it. Fuck me. 4 times create github repo back to back

# Log 1

Fuck i forgot to add the gitignore first then it just fucking take in all of the Debug folder

That's why you see this repo fucking open and delete and open and delete thrice

Fuck me
